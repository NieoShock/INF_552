## Homework_1 (100/100)
This Biomedical data set was built by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residence
period in Lyon, France. Each patient in the data set is represented in the data set
by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis
and lumbar spine (in this order): pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle,
sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. The following convention is
used for the class labels: DH (Disk Hernia), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO) and
Abnormal (AB). In this exercise, we only focus on a binary classification task NO=0
and AB=1

## Homework_2 (100/100)
The dataset contains data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over
6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features
consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP),
Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical
energy output (EP) of the plant.

## Homework_3 (100/100)
An interesting task in machine learning is classification of time series. In this problem,
we will classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless
Sensor Network.

## Homework_4
1.The LASSO and Boosting for Regression
	Download the Communities and Crime data1 from https://archive.ics.uci.
edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime. Use the first 1495 rows of data as
the training set and the rest as the test set.

2. Tree-Based Methods
	Download the APS Failure data from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/
APS+Failure+at+Scania+Trucks . The dataset contains a training set and a test
set. The training set contains 60,000 rows, of which 1,000 belong to the positive
class and 171 columns, of which one is the class column. All attributes are numeric.
