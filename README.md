## Homework_1
This Biomedical data set was built by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residence
period in Lyon, France. Each patient in the data set is represented in the data set
by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis
and lumbar spine (in this order): pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle,
sacral slope, pelvic radius and grade of spondylolisthesis. The following convention is
used for the class labels: DH (Disk Hernia), Spondylolisthesis (SL), Normal (NO) and
Abnormal (AB). In this exercise, we only focus on a binary classification task NO=0
and AB=1

## Homework_2
The dataset contains data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over
6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features
consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP),
Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical
energy output (EP) of the plant.

## Homework_3
An interesting task in machine learning is classification of time series. In this problem,
we will classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless
Sensor Network.
